# Python-Mini-Project
# For those who works in ACRES not in HOURS

The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.

This is my First ever mini-project done by me in Python in order to stop deaths of farmers and small contribution for them to make their lives simpler.. :)

For making Elegant UI(User Interface) i had used **tkinter**.
Command for installing tkinter as follows:
```
pip install tkinter
```

For adding images on UI i used pillow library using:
```
pip install pillow
```
